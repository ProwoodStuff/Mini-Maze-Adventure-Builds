# Mini Maze Adventure Beta Builds
The full source code of prior builds of 'Mini Maze Adventure', dating back to December of 2022.
The works seen in this is still protected under Copyright from Brock, you are free to modify the work and sell it, however all works derrived from these builds must have me credited in them.

These builds still carry the original name of 'Mini Amogus Adventure', a joke based on the idea of an Among Us Game on the Atari 2600. Coded in BAtari Basic, meaning that it should be built to run on it and Native Atari 2600 hardware, I am not liable for any issues relating to problems starting the game. 

If you would like to play the game on your PC through emulation or on actual hardware, a ROM of the full game is available [here](https://prowoodstuff.itch.io/mini-maze-adventure), getting it onto a cartridge is up to you.
